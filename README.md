# BarfAndBel.ch-Chrome-Extension
The Chrome extension that gives you DreamWorks Dragons quotes every time you open a new tab!

In 2015, Iantje created the website [BarfAndBel.ch](http://barfandbel.ch) - website that gave you a different DreamWorks Dragons quote and image every time you refreshed the page. My immediate thought was that it would be perfect for a new tab page - giving you a How to Train Your Dragon image and quote every time you opened a new tab. And thus this extension was born.

If you want to try the extension out, you can install it on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/barfandbelch/ighopclhjeijlgfnjelnhnhdeheeaflh).

Or (and more likely since you're reading this) if you want to see how it works, go and have a look at the code! It's very simple actually.

If you have ideas, suggestions, or comments, please [leave a review](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/barfandbelch/ighopclhjeijlgfnjelnhnhdeheeaflh/reviews) on the extension. Or if you want a feature, and know how to add it yourself, send me a pull request!
